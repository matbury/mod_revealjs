Presentation module (reveal.js)
==============================

The Presentation module is an alternative to PowerPoint, PDF, and other
web-unfriendly formats.

It uses the free and open source JavaScript slide show library, reveal.js

See: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js which includes helpful documentation
for creating and editing presentations.

reveal.js can also be used as a standalone presentation player (in a web browser)
and be used for creating, editing, and previewing presentations before uploading
them to Moodle.

There is an online presentation editor at: http://slid.es However, it is not
free and open source and creating a "freemium" account is required to use it.

Installation

1. Upload `/revealjs/` directory and all its contents to `/moodle/mod/` 
2. In Moodle, login as administrator
3. Go to Administration > Site administration > Notifications
4. Installation process will initiate (follow the on-screen instructions)

During the installation process, the Presentation Module will attempt to move 
the `/moodle/mod/revealjs/revealjs/` directory to `/moodledata/repository/`
If this fails, you will have to move the directory and all its contents manually.

There's an example presentation in `/revealjs/_revealjs_/matbury/sdl_learner/` to 
get you started
